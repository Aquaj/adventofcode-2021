What a Christmas this has been! You of course managed to save it by recovering the sleigh keys just in time, but then you had to spend two entire weeks in a decompression chamber upon our return from the depths of the ocean. But that's all behind you: Once the large seven-segment display-style countdown timer in the chamber had ticked down to zero, you had only one plan: A nice, long and well-deserved vacation. You're just getting comfortable as the **ADVENT** (the **A**mazing **D**evice for **V**ery **E**xciting **N**orth Pole **T**ransmissions of course), a thank-you gift from Santa himself, in your pocket starts to beep repeatedly. "What now?", you sigh, activating the screen.It looks like you have received a set of encoded messages from all over the world, forwarded to you from North Pole HQ (this is your puzzle input).

Wondering what this could be about, you try to remember what you'd been reading in the transmission protocol manual to pass the time in the chamber:

-   Santa's preferred method for receiving wish lists is via secured and encrypted message.
-   Everyone who made Santa's list has a unique encryption key which they use to encode their message before it is sent.
-   Santa and his helpers hold the respective decryption keys and are able to decipher the message again.
-   Keys are comma-separated sets of numbers, and all encryption and decryption keys have the same length.
-   For extra security, keys become more complex each day during Christmas time up until Santa starts to travel.

Turns out, the ADVENT actually comes with a digital version of the manual and a few samples of encryption and decryption keys (separated by a space).

Now, of course you know your own encryption key (it's what you've been using to send your wish list after all!), but it looks like you will need everyone's decryption keys to decode these messages. Luckily, the ADVENT in its newest version has live access to **[The Christmas Database](https://aoc.lewagon.community/)**. You wonder if there is something in there to help you find the keys...

***What is the product of the elements of your own decryption key, first of all?***

Now that you have obtained your decryption key and a way to get everyone else's (a security flaw you've already alerted the elves to -- their reply over **BITS** was "HI"), you should be able to decode the messages. You vaguely remember glossing over some boring rules on how the decryption works -- time for a little refresher:

-   Messages are encoded using a combination of shifts. Their encrypted length is always the same as the original.
-   A recent update in the encryption system added an extra layer of **SNOW** (**S**uperior & **N**ovel **O**bfuscation **W**rapper): The decryption cipher is actually a combination of the decryption key and the sender identifier:

-   If the sender identifier is an even number, it is added to the product of the decryption key sequence.
-   If the sender identifier is an odd number, it is subtracted from the product of the decryption key sequence.
-   Using the absolute value of the above calculation result, the cipher is the sequence of every third digit, starting from the left.

122: 7,2,5,3,4,10,5 6,8,1,2,2,20,2 -> 6*8*1*2*2*20*2 + 122 => 7802 => 72
87: 4,4,3,17,5,6,8 1,3,2,22,4,4,3 -> 1*3*2*22*4*4*3 - 87 => 6249 => 69
40: 12,25,5,-1,4,7,7 18,20,-1,1,5,8,10 -> 18*20*-1*1*5*8*10 + 40 => 143960 => 19

-   The resulting cipher is then turned into a [ternary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_numeral_system) and processed from right to left. For each trit:

-   If the trit is a 1, shift the entire encoded message left by one character (the first character becomes the last).
-   If the trit is a 2, shift the entire encoded message right by the trit's positional value (characters chopped off the end get added back to the beginning).
-   If the trit is a 0, reverse the message string.

For cipher 46, the ternary representation is 1201. Suppose our string is abcde:
abcde -(shift left by 1)> bcdea -(reverse)> aedcb -(shift right by 9)> edcba -(shift left by 1)> dcbae

-   Finally, the shifted message characters are decoded using a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher):

-   Get the prime factors of your original cipher (in decimal) and shift each character along the Rudolphabet* by their sum.
-   If your cipher is a prime number (i.e. if its only prime factors are 1 and itself), add 5 to the sum before you shift.

**North Pole HQ uses a special alphabet called the Rudolphabet. It works almost like the normal alphabet, except that the letter order follows their first appearance in the* *[popular song lyrics](https://www.41051.com/xmaslyrics/rudolph.html)**. This includes, separately, lower- and upper-case letters. All remaining letters, punctuation marks, special characters and the space character are ignored and stay at the end. The Rudolphabet repeats over and over; if you have to shift further than its length, simply append the missing characters again.**North Pole HQ previously used the* *[Jinglebet](https://www.41051.com/xmaslyrics/jingle.html)**, which turned the standard alphabet* `*ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 .!?,;:'-#()*` *into* `*DashingtrouewOplfdLyBbmkWAjJIMFTNGHcCEKPQRSUVXYZqvxz0123456789 .!?,;:'-#()*`*.*

Using the Jinglebet, for cipher 46, we shift by 23+2+1 = 26: D becomes j, a becomes J, s becomes I and so on.

-   If the trit is a 2, shift the entire encoded message right by the trit's magnitude (characters chopped off the end get added back to the beginning).
-   If the trit is a 0, reverse the message string.

For cipher 46, the ternary representation is 1201. Suppose our string is abcde:
abcde -(shift left by 1)> bcdea -(reverse)> aedcb -(shift right by 3^2 = 9)> edcba -(shift left by 1)> dcbae
