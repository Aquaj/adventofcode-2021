## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).
Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight
(EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Advent of Code 2021 Story

**TODO: Fill in when available**

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second
puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Context

**Done during [Le Wagon x AoC challenge](http://lewagon-aoc.herokuapp.com/)**

**These were not written as example of clean or efficient code** but are simply my attempts at finding the answers to
each day's puzzle as quickly as possible. Performance logging was added simply as a fun way to compare implementations
with other competitors.

## Running the code

Each day computes and displays the answers to both of the day questions and their computing time in ms. To run it type `ruby day<number>.rb`.

If the session cookie value is provided through the SESSION env variable (dotenv is available to provide it) â€” it will
fetch the input from the website and store it as a file under the `inputs/` folder on its first run.
